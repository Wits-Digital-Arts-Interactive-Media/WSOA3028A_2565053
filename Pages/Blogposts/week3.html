      <p id="Paragraph-Style3"> 
        My goal for this website is to create a website that displays my work, my ability or any previous projects I had made solely for employers 
        in the programming and/or people in the gaming industry, as this is my target audience regarding this website. I want this to be a token of 
        my ability that shows I am able to get the job done and get it done well, with maximum efficency. <br>
        <br>
        Overall, I will make this website easy to read and easy for the employers to navigate, with all my work and ability being displayed through 
        this website. I want the user to understand my intentions right from the jump, the user needs to know exactly what my website is(Portfolio).

      <P id="Paragraph-Style3-Site content">
        <b>Homepage</b> - The heart of my website is the homepage. As this will be the central point that links the 4 other pages that I am looking to have.<br>
        <b>Blog posts</b> - The page for all my courses blogposts for each week.<br>
        <b>Web design</b> - I am planning to have the outline for my process of how I went about designing my website.<br>
        <b>Portfolio</b> - My goal with this page is to be able to display any projects that I had previously did before, the aim is to showcase my abilty in 
        programming and game design. I will try to include some downloadabe files, for users to be able to interact with my projects. I am not quite sure how the whole process of using files.

      <h2 id="Week 3 Header">Reflect on how the exercise above relates to what you know about your structure and URL scheme, 
        and how it relates to semantic markup 
      </h2>
          
      <p id="Paragraph-Style3">The exercise above relates to this idea of structure. A structure that is very carefully designed, for the sole purpose
        that your users lives are made easy. Through careful design, and mapping out the way a user navigates your site is imperative 
        for the user overall experience. As having a user navigate a unstructured site aimlessly will not only have a negative effect 
        on their experience, but it will clearly indicate the ineffectiveness of a websites design.<br>
        <br>
        As for how it relates to semantic markup. From what I've looked at, semantic markup makes your code easier to understand for 
        other developers or people who may view this project, or for myself as well. Just as a well-organized folder structure helps 
        locate files more easily, semantic markup assists in the understanding of the content structure more intuitively.

      <h2 id="Week 3 Header">Reflect on your development progress for the week</h2>
      
      <p id="Paragraph-Style3">This week I have not done much coding. I decided to take some more time  to delve into HTML, during this time I learnt
        a lot about HTML. I am certain that upon the next coding session I would be able to implement a lot of the ideas I have using HTML. During
        this time, I did a lot of research and watched multiple tutorials on HTML. I learnt about the importance of semantic markup language and I
        am excited to put my new found knowledge to the test.
