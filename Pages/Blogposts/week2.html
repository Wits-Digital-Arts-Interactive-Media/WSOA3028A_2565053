      <h2 class="blogs-H2">Folder Structure and URL Scheme</h2>
      <p class="blogs-paragraph">
        With some of my previous knowledge on building games I am fully aware that organizing my project is like
        laying
        the groundwork
        for a building; it needs to be robust and well-planned. I've opted for a clear and intuitive folder structure
        that
        ensures easy
        navigation for both development and future updates. Each section of my website has its dedicated folder, and
        I've
        incorporated a
        logical URL scheme that reflects the content hierarchy. My overall folder structure not only facilitates easy
        navigation during
        development but also sets a solid foundation for future scalability and makes the processing of updating my
        website much easier.
        This will not only streamline the development process for me but also enhances user experience.

      <h2 class="blogs-H2">Decision-Making Process</h2>
      <p class="blogs-paragraph">
        I based my decisions on the simplicity and scalability of the structure. A well-organized folder system not
        only
        aids in development but
        also facilitates content updates without causing chaos. The URL scheme, being an extension of this,
        contributes to
        creating user-friendly
        and easily shareable links.

      <h2 class="blogs-H2">Thoughts Behind Wireframes</h2>
      <p class="blogs-paragraph">
        In these early stages, I'm focusing on the fundamental elements â€“ navigation, content placement, and user
        interaction. The wireframes serve
        as a blueprint, helping me conceptualize the user journey and fine-tune the design before delving into the
        intricacies of coding with HTML.

      <h2 class="blogs-H2">UI Wire frames</h2>
      <p class="blogs-paragraph"">Before I began designing my UI wireframes, I thought about how I would like my website to
          look. I then researched
          further and found out that each section of a web page is defined by specific sections, which have specific names.
          E.G The hero section - A
          prominent and visually striking section at the top of a webpage. It is one of the first elements that users see
          when they land on a website,
          typically occupying a large portion of the screen. The hero section serves as a crucial introduction, capturing
          the attention of visitors
          and conveying key messages about the website or brand.<br>
          <br>
          With the image I had in mind combined with my new found knowledge of the specific sections of a webpage. I decided
          to map out the image in
          my mind, with a better way of defining the specific sections and with that I came up with the first wireframe for
          my Home Page below.

      <h2 class="blogs-H2">Reflecting on Moulthrop, S. (2003)</h2>
      <p class="blogs-paragraph">
        Moulthrop's 'You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)' is a thought-provoking piece
        that resonates even in today's
        internet landscape. Drawing parallels between hypertext and the internet, Moulthrop challenges us to rethink our
        approach to information
        dissemination. How do the evolving laws of media shape our digital experiences? It's a question worth pondering
        as
        we navigate the dynamic online world.<br>
        <br>
        Delving into this inquiry, let's explore how hypertext, a revolutionary concept in information organization,
        profoundly influences our online encounters.
        The internet's structural foundation, heavily shaped by hypertext principles, initiates a paradigm shift in the
        way information is not only presented but,
        more crucially, how users access and navigate this vast digital landscape.<br>
        <br>
        Consider hyperlinks as dynamic connectors, acting as pathways within this expansive information network. These
        virtual bridges empower users, allowing them
        to effortlessly traverse the digital realm, hopping between diverse topics and ideas with unprecedented ease.
        Unlike the traditional linear pathways, hypertext
        introduces a non-linear structure, providing users with the freedom to craft their own unique journeys through
        the
        vast sea of interconnected content.<br>
        <br>
        This interconnected web of information fundamentally shapes our online experiences. It transforms the act of
        exploration from a rigid, linear process into a
        fluid and intuitive one. Users are no longer confined to a predetermined route; instead, they navigate a web of
        possibilities, following their curiosity and
        seamlessly jumping between different information nodes. This dynamic, interconnected approach not only enhances
        user engagement but also encourages a more
        participatory and personalized digital experience.<br>
        <br>
        In essence, by understanding the impact of hypertext, we gain insight into the intricate architecture of the
        internet, where the way information is structured
        mirrors the flexibility and interconnectedness of human thought. The virtual pathways created by hyperlinks
        contribute to a digital landscape where exploration
        feels natural, intuitive, and uniquely tailored to each user's preferences and curiosities. This transformative
        influence underscores the enduring relevance of
        Moulthrop's insights as we navigate the complexities of the ever-evolving online world.

      <h2 class="blogs-H2">Interaction and the WWW</h2>
      <p class="blogs-paragraph">
        Interaction, to me, is the heartbeat of the World Wide Web. It's the bridge between users and content, making
        the
        online experience dynamic
        and engaging. As I craft my project, I'm keeping user interaction at the forefront. How can I make the user
        experience seamless and enjoyable?
        What interactive elements will enhance engagement? These are the questions guiding my design choices.
