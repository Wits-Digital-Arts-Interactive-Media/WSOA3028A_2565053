      <h2>CSS Styling and HTML Structure</h2>
      <h3>Semantic HTML:</h3>
      <p>One of the foundational principles guiding my HTML structure is semantic markup. By choosing semantic elements
        like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;, I ensure clarity and accessibility in
        the document outline. This not only aids search engine optimization but also enhances screen reader
        compatibility and overall code maintainability.</p>

      <h3>Responsive Design:</h3>
      <p>My CSS rules are meticulously crafted to prioritize responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes. I
        employ techniques like media queries, flexbox, and grid layout to create fluid, adaptive layouts that seamlessly
        adjust to different viewport dimensions. This ensures a consistent and optimal user experience, regardless of
        whether the site is accessed on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.</p>

      <h3>Color Palette and Typography:</h3>
      <p>Every color choice and typographic decision is deliberate, reflecting the brand identity and visual tone I aim
        to convey. I select colors that evoke the desired emotions and complement each other harmoniously, promoting
        readability and aesthetic appeal. Typography plays a crucial role in enhancing content legibility and hierarchy,
        with careful attention given to font styles, sizes, and spacing.</p>

      <h2>JavaScript Interaction with CSS and HTML</h2>
      <p>In terms of the relationship between CSS, JavaScript, and HTML, I have kept a consistent structure for how I
        manage to interconnect the 3 languages to craft my website. I use the same process for each page and it keeps
        everything consistent for my site.</p>

      <h3>Enhanced User Experience:</h3>
      <p>JavaScript adds layers of interactivity and dynamism to my website, elevating it beyond static content. For
        instance, the animateText() function brings textual content to life, creating engaging animations that capture
        the user's attention and convey information in an engaging manner. By leveraging JavaScript animations in tandem
        with CSS transitions, I ensure smooth and visually appealing effects that enhance user engagement.</p>

      <h3>Dynamic Content Loading:</h3>
      <p>JavaScript facilitates dynamic content loading, enabling seamless transitions between pages and dynamic updates
        without full page reloads. Functions like loadlatestBlogPage() and loadPortfolioPage() enable users to navigate
        between different sections of the site effortlessly, enhancing usability and reducing friction in the browsing
        experience.</p>

      <h3>Integration with External APIs:</h3>
      <p>Through JavaScript, I harness the power of external APIs to enrich the user experience with real-time data and
        functionality. For example, the stock price API integration in the "Real-Time Stock Price" section enables users
        to fetch the latest stock prices dynamically. This not only adds value to the website but also showcases the
        integration of dynamic content within the existing HTML structure, demonstrating the versatility and power of
        JavaScript in enhancing website functionality.</p>

      <h2>Decolonialism in Coding Practice</h2>
      <h3>Acknowledging Power Dynamics:</h3>
      <p>In coding practice, it's crucial to acknowledge the power dynamics that exist within the tech industry.
        Historically, technology has been developed and controlled by certain groups, often to the exclusion of others.
        This has resulted in biases in algorithms, lack of diversity in tech teams, and the marginalization of certain
        communities. By acknowledging these power dynamics, developers can work towards creating more inclusive and
        equitable technology.</p>

      <h3>Challenging Biases and Colonial Legacies:</h3>
      <p>Colonialism has left lasting impacts on language, culture, and society, which can manifest in coding practice.
        For example, using colonial language or imagery in code comments or documentation can perpetuate colonial
        narratives and marginalize Indigenous or minority communities. Challenging these biases and colonial legacies
        involves being mindful of the language and imagery used in coding practice and actively working to dismantle
        colonial structures within the tech industry.</p>

      <h3>Centering Diverse Perspectives:</h3>
      <p>One way to decolonize coding practice is to center diverse perspectives and voices. This includes actively
        seeking out and listening to the experiences of marginalized communities in technology, amplifying their voices,
        and ensuring that their needs are considered in the design and development process. By centering diverse
        perspectives, developers can create technology that is more inclusive, equitable, and representative of the
        diverse range of users it serves.</p>
