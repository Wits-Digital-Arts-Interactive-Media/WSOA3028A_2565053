        <h2 class="blogs-H2">CSS Styling and HTML Structure</h2>
        <h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
        <p class="blogs-paragraph">One of the foundational principles guiding my HTML structure is semantic markup. By
          choosing semantic elements
          like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;, I ensure clarity and accessibility in
          the document outline. This not only aids search engine optimization but also enhances screen reader
          compatibility and overall code maintainability.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blogs-H2">Responsive Design</h2>
        <p class="blogs-paragraph">My CSS rules are meticulously crafted to prioritize responsiveness across various
          devices and screen sizes. I
          employ techniques like media queries, flexbox, and grid layout to create fluid, adaptive layouts that
          seamlessly
          adjust to different viewport dimensions. This ensures a consistent and optimal user experience, regardless of
          whether the site is accessed on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blogs-H2">Color Palette and Typography</h2>
        <p class="blogs-paragraph">Every color choice and typographic decision is deliberate, reflecting the brand
          identity and visual tone I aim
          to convey. I select colors that evoke the desired emotions and complement each other harmoniously, promoting
          readability and aesthetic appeal. Typography plays a crucial role in enhancing content legibility and
          hierarchy,
          with careful attention given to font styles, sizes, and spacing.</p>



        <h2 class="blogs-H2">JavaScript Interaction with CSS and HTML</h2>
        <p class="blogs-paragraph">In terms of the relationship between CSS, JavaScript, and HTML, I have kept a
          consistent structure for how I
          manage to interconnect the 3 languages to craft my website. I use the same process for each page and it keeps
          everything consistent for my site.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blogs-H2">Enhanced User Experience</h2>
        <p class="blogs-paragraph">JavaScript adds layers of interactivity and dynamism to my website, elevating it
          beyond static content. For
          instance, the animateText() function brings textual content to life, creating engaging animations that capture
          the user's attention and convey information in an engaging manner. By leveraging JavaScript animations in
          tandem
          with CSS transitions, I ensure smooth and visually appealing effects that enhance user engagement.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blogs-H2">Dynamic Content Loading</h2>
        <p class="blogs-paragraph">JavaScript facilitates dynamic content loading, enabling seamless transitions between
          pages and dynamic updates
          without full page reloads. Functions like loadlatestBlogPage() and loadPortfolioPage() enable users to
          navigate
          between different sections of the site effortlessly, enhancing usability and reducing friction in the browsing
          experience.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blogs-H2">Integration with External APIs</h2>
        <p class="blogs-paragraph">Through JavaScript, I harness the power of external APIs to enrich the user
          experience with real-time data and
          functionality. For example, the stock price API integration in the "Real-Time Stock Price" section enables
          users
          to fetch the latest stock prices dynamically. This not only adds value to the website but also showcases the
          integration of dynamic content within the existing HTML structure, demonstrating the versatility and power of
          JavaScript in enhancing website functionality.
        </p>



        <h2 class="blogs-H2">Decolonialism in Coding Practice</h2>
        <h3>Acknowledging Power Dynamics:</h3>
        <p class="blogs-paragraph">In coding practice, it's crucial to acknowledge the power dynamics that exist within
          the tech industry.
          Historically, technology has been developed and controlled by certain groups, often to the exclusion of
          others.
          This has resulted in biases in algorithms, lack of diversity in tech teams, and the marginalization of certain
          communities. By acknowledging these power dynamics, developers can work towards creating more inclusive and
          equitable technology.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blogs-H2">Challenging Biases and Colonial Legacies</h2>
        <p class="blogs-paragraph">Colonialism has left lasting impacts on language, culture, and society, which can
          manifest in coding practice.
          For example, using colonial language or imagery in code comments or documentation can perpetuate colonial
          narratives and marginalize Indigenous or minority communities. Challenging these biases and colonial legacies
          involves being mindful of the language and imagery used in coding practice and actively working to dismantle
          colonial structures within the tech industry.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blogs-H2">Centering Diverse Perspectives</h2>
        <p class="blogs-paragraph">One way to decolonize coding practice is to center diverse perspectives and voices.
          This includes actively
          seeking out and listening to the experiences of marginalized communities in technology, amplifying their
          voices,
          and ensuring that their needs are considered in the design and development process. By centering diverse
          perspectives, developers can create technology that is more inclusive, equitable, and representative of the
          diverse range of users it serves.
