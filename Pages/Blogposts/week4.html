      <h2 class="blogs-H2">Goal Alignment</h2>
      <p class="blogs-paragraph">My goal hasn't developed much since I have written week 3's blogpost. However, I have
        decided that I will certainly
        add more into my project, trying to upload some .exe files that are downloadable for any employers to be able to
        test some of my games.That
        being said I am still keeping the same commitments and considerations in mind as I continue to craft my website.

      <h2 class="blogs-H2">Information Structure</h2>
      <p class="blogs-paragraph">Below you can see the information structure that I am trying to implement. The cycling
        between pages smoothly is
        represented by the green arrows. The user is able to cycle between rach web page back and forth. But the
        structure
        cleaely shows that it will
        require the user to go back to the home page at all times.

      <h2 class="blogs-H2">Interface Elements</h2>
      <p class="blogs-paragraph">In designing my website's interface elements, simplicity and functionality will be
        paramount. Each element, from
        buttons to navigation bars, I will meticulously craft to prioritize ease of use and clarity. Embracing
        minimalist
        aesthetics, I will ensure
        that every interface element served a clear purpose without unnecessary distractions.By prioritizing simplicity
        and functionality in
        interface design, I aimed to enhance the overall user experience and facilitate effortless interaction with the
        content.

      <h2 class="blogs-H2">Style Process</h2>
      <p class="blogs-paragraph">In crafting my website's design, I prioritized minimalism and clarity. The color
        palette,
        featuring muted tones and
        subtle contrasts, aims to create a tranquil backdrop that directs focus to the content. Clean lines and
        sufficent
        whitespace in the layout
        enhance readability and navigation, fostering a sense of sophistication. Sans-serif fonts is what I will be
        looking at for their simplicity
        and legibility, ensuring seamless readability across screens. Every design decision was made with a commitment
        to
        simplicity, functionality,
        and user experience at its core.

      <h2 class="blogs-H2">Reflection</h2>
      <p class="blogs-paragraph">Reflecting on everything I have done and learnt thus far. I am quite content with what
        I
        have produced. I found the
        process of making this website to be insightful. I have learnt a lot about HTMl, which makes quite happy. Given
        that I have had some previous
        coding expereince, I found that learning HTMl was an enjoyable experience. The biggest thing i learnt with HTML
        is
        that having the attribute
        list alongside you, while you code is imperative because as you get used to using specific tags repetitively
        eventually you will not need
        the tag list anymore.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blogs-H2">Stuggles</h2>
      <p class="blogs-paragraph">My biggest challenge was trying to not incorporate CSS and stick solely with HTML. I
        found
        this to be quite challenging,
        as I was to quick and hesitant to start making it look nice. However the entire process has been more insightful
        rather than challenging to me.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blogs-H2">Changes going forward</h2>
      <p class="blogs-paragraph">There are some things I want to change in the logic of my code. E.G the way i did the
        Navbar, I want to find a better way
        to display my navbar. Howeveri do think CSS will help with this.
