      <h2 id ="Week-4-Header"></p>Goal Alignment</h2>
      <p id ="Paragraph-Style4">My goal hasn't developed much since I have written week 3's blogpost. However, I have decided that I will certainly 
        add more into my project, trying to upload some .exe files that are downloadable for any employers to be able to test some of my games.That 
        being said I am still keeping the same commitments and considerations in mind as I continue to craft my website.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id ="Week-4-Header"></p>Information Structure</h2>
      <p id ="Paragraph-Style4">Below you can see the information structure that I am trying to implement. The cycling between pages smoothly is 
      represented by the green arrows. The user is able to cycle between rach web page back and forth. But the structure cleaely shows that it will
      require the user to go back to the home page at all times.
      </p>

      <h2 id ="Week-4-Header"></p>User Flow</h2>
      <p id ="Paragraph-Style4"> Below you can see a diagram of the user flow for my website:</p>
      <img id= "UserFlow-Photo" src="../../Images/Web design/UserFlow.jpg">
  
      <h2 id ="Week-4-Header"></p>Interface Elements</h2>
      <p id ="Paragraph-Style4">In designing my website's interface elements, simplicity and functionality will be paramount. Each element, from
        buttons to navigation bars, I will meticulously craft to prioritize ease of use and clarity. Embracing minimalist aesthetics, I will ensure 
        that every interface element served a clear purpose without unnecessary distractions.By prioritizing simplicity and functionality in 
        interface design, I aimed to enhance the overall user experience and facilitate effortless interaction with the content.
      </p>
  
      <h2 id ="Week-4-Header"></p>Style Process</h2>
      <p id ="Paragraph-Style4">In crafting my website's design, I prioritized minimalism and clarity. The color palette, featuring muted tones and
        subtle contrasts, aims to create a tranquil backdrop that directs focus to the content. Clean lines and sufficent whitespace in the layout 
        enhance readability and navigation, fostering a sense of sophistication. Sans-serif fonts is what I will be looking at for their simplicity
        and legibility, ensuring seamless readability across screens. Every design decision was made with a commitment to simplicity, functionality,
        and user experience at its core.
      </p>
  
    <h2 id ="Week-4-Header"></p>Reflection</h2>
    <p id ="Paragraph-Style4">Reflecting on everything I have done and learnt thus far. I am quite content with what I have produced. I found the
      process of making this website to be insightful. I have learnt a lot about HTMl, which makes quite happy. Given that I have had some previous
      coding expereince, I found that learning HTMl was an enjoyable experience. The biggest thing i learnt with HTML is that having the attribute 
      list alongside you, while you code is imperative because as you get used to using specific tags repetitively eventually you will not need 
      the tag list anymore.
    </p>

    <h3 id ="Week-4-Header"></p>Stuggles</h3>
    <p id ="Paragraph-Style4">My biggest challenge was trying to not incorporate CSS and stick solely with HTML. I found this to be quite challenging,
      as I was to quick and hesitant to start making it look nice. However the entire process has been more insightful rather than challenging to me.
    </p>
      
    <h3 id ="Week-4-Header"></p>Changes going forward</h3>
    <p id ="Paragraph-Style4">There are some things I want to change in the logic of my code. E.G the way i did the Navbar, I want to find a better way 
    to display my navbar. Howeveri do think CSS will help with this.
