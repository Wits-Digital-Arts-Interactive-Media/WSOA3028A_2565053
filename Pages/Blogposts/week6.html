                    <h2>Website 1: Deloitte</h2>
                <p>
                    Deloitte's website stands as a bastion of corporate digital presence, embodying the essence of a
                    multifaceted entity operating at the pinnacle of professional services. Yet, beneath its polished
                    exterior lies a labyrinth of design choices, navigational structures, and user engagement tactics,
                    all of which warrant a deep dive for meaningful analysis.

                    At the core of any website analysis lies the pivotal question of balance – a delicate equilibrium
                    between information dissemination and user engagement. Deloitte's digital platform serves as a
                    conduit for a wealth of knowledge, spanning industry insights, thought leadership articles, and
                    service offerings. However, amidst this wealth of content, lies the challenge of ensuring that users
                    not only access but also actively engage with the information presented. In dissecting Deloitte's
                    website, one must scrutinize the pathways through which users navigate this sea of content. Are
                    these pathways intuitive, guiding users seamlessly from one section to another? Or do they present
                    stumbling blocks, impeding the flow of information and hindering user exploration? By critically
                    evaluating these navigation pathways, one can uncover opportunities to streamline the user journey,
                    facilitating a more fluid and engaging experience.

                    Moreover, the analysis must extend beyond the surface-level interaction with the website's interface
                    to delve into the realm of user experience (UX) design. How does Deloitte's website cater to the
                    diverse needs and preferences of its users? Are interactive features thoughtfully integrated to
                    enhance engagement, or do they remain underutilized, overshadowed by the sheer volume of static
                    content? By engaging critically with the UX/UI elements, such as interactive widgets, multimedia
                    assets, and micro-interactions, one can discern the extent to which Deloitte's website succeeds in
                    captivating and retaining user interest.

                    Furthermore, the issue of personalization looms large in the digital landscape, as users
                    increasingly expect tailored experiences that cater to their individual preferences and interests.
                    Here lies an opportunity for Deloitte to leverage its vast repository of data and insights to
                    deliver personalized content recommendations, curated specifically for each user. However, the
                    absence of robust personalization features may hinder the website's ability to resonate with users
                    on a personal level, potentially resulting in diminished engagement and conversion rates. By
                    exploring the intricacies of personalization – from content recommendation algorithms to user
                    segmentation strategies – one can unearth opportunities for Deloitte to elevate the user experience
                    and drive meaningful interactions.

                    In essence, the analysis of Deloitte's website transcends the realm of superficial observations,
                    necessitating a deep and critical examination of its design, functionality, and user-centricity. By
                    engaging with these aspects thoughtfully and analytically, one can uncover valuable insights and
                    opportunities for optimization, ultimately enhancing the website's effectiveness as a communication
                    channel and reinforcing Deloitte's position as a leader in the professional services industry.

                <h2>
                    Changes to website for the week:
                </h2>

                
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>
                    Updated Folder Structure (Iteration 2)
                </h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../../Images/Web design/FolderStructure/FolderStructure-Iteration2.jpg"></img>
                    <figcaption>
                        For my folder structure I have, opted to stick with my previous root folder to my main
                        folders. Except with iteration 2, I am aiming to improve the idea of making certain aspects of
                        my
                        website more scalable, manageable as well as keeping my organization and content separation at
                        it's
                        most organized state. Hence, the main changes I will make is regarding the additional folders I
                        have
                        opted to include. For each of the main 6 web pages. They will all have their own folder,
                        relating to
                        the individual aspects of the website which I have broken up into 4 main sections. The HTML
                        part,
                        the CSS part, the Java and lastly the images I am planning to include. These changes are purely
                        for
                        the improvement of the backend of my website, as the feedback I was given related to the notion
                        of
                        my current structure for my blogposts not being scalable. I then decided to look further into
                        all of
                        my folders and the solution above is what I derived at.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>
                    Updated corrections of code and semantic markup changes
                </h3>
                <P>
                    Taking the feedback into account, I looked back on my scripts. I made a lot of changes with regards
                    to
                    semantic markup. I have opted for the exact same structure for each page. I divided each pages
                    section
                    into 3 main tags. Header, Main and Footer and using this structure I will build onto each section
                    within
                    these tags for each page. I have included an Hr tag as well, just for content separation and to make
                    the
                    overall code much easier to read and understand what was going on.

                    Secondly the feedback mentioned the inappropriate use of headers and microformatting. My solution to
                    this was to have only 1 main H1 tag for every single html document which I define as the 1 main
                    Header
                    defining the overall content for each page. Thereafter, every other heading was made an H2 to H6
                    depending on the heading.

                    Lastly, with regards to shoehorning in divs, I have opted to use the section and article tags to
                    define
                    specific content and section off content not relating to each other, the aim was to improve the
                    semantic
                    markup and improve upon the hard coding of the same tags. I had learnt that it makes the HTML
                    scripts
                    much easier to read when using very specific semantic markup elements rather than making everything
                    divs
                    and giving them classes or IDs to define what they're meant to be instead of using semantic markup
                    to
                    define it for you. Which in essence actually makes my life easier and the person reading the
                    script's
                    life easier.
