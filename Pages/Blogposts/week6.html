                    In analyzing Deloitte's website, it's essential to move beyond surface-level observations and delve
                    into
                    the intricacies of its design and user experience. While the site benefits from the credibility of
                    the
                    Deloitte brand, its complexity may present challenges for analysis. To go deeper, we can scrutinize
                    specific UX/UI elements, such as navigation pathways, information architecture, and interactive
                    features, to understand how they contribute to the overall user experience.

                    Moreover, we can critically assess how well Deloitte's website balances information dissemination
                    with
                    user engagement. Given its corporate nature, there might be a tendency to prioritize content
                    delivery
                    over interactive elements that enhance user experience. Exploring this balance and considering
                    alternative design approaches could lead to valuable insights into optimizing corporate websites for
                    both informational value and user engagement.

                    Additionally, we can examine the website's personalization features, or lack thereof, and discuss
                    their
                    implications for user engagement and conversion rates. By comparing Deloitte's approach to
                    personalization with industry best practices, we can offer recommendations for enhancing user
                    experience
                    through tailored content delivery.

                    Changes to website for the week:
                </h2>

            <section>
                <h3>
                    Updated Folder Structure (Iteration 2)
                </h3>

                    <figcaption>
                        For my folder structure I have, opted to stick with my previous root folder to my main
                        folders. Except with iteration 2, I am aiming to improve the idea of making certain aspects of
                        my
                        website more scalable, manageable as well as keeping my organization and content separation at
                        it's
                        most organized state. Hence, the main changes I will make is regarding the additional folders I
                        have
                        opted to include. For each of the main 6 web pages. They will all have their own folder,
                        relating to
                        the individual aspects of the website which I have broken up into 4 main sections. The HTML
                        part,
                        the CSS part, the Java and lastly the images I am planning to include. These changes are purely
                        for
                        the improvement of the backend of my website, as the feedback I was given related to the notion
                        of
                        my current structure for my blogposts not being scalable. I then decided to look further into
                        all of
                        my folders and the solution above is what I derived at.

                <h3>
                    Updated corrections of code and semantic markup changes
                </h3>
                <P>
                    Taking the feedback into account, I looked back on my scripts. I made a lot of changes with regards
                    to
                    semantic markup. I have opted for the exact same structure for each page. I divided each pages
                    section
                    into 3 main tags. Header, Main and Footer and using this structure I will build onto each section
                    within
                    these tags for each page. I have included an Hr tag as well, just for content separation and to make
                    the
                    overall code much easier to read and understand what was going on.

                    Secondly the feedback mentioned the inappropriate use of headers and microformatting. My solution to
                    this was to have only 1 main H1 tag for every single html document which I define as the 1 main
                    Header
                    defining the overall content for each page. Thereafter, every other heading was made an H2 to H6
                    depending on the heading.

                    Lastly, with regards to shoehorning in divs, I have opted to use the section and article tags to
                    define
                    specific content and section off content not relating to each other, the aim was to improve the
                    semantic
                    markup and improve upon the hard coding of the same tags. I had learnt that it makes the HTML
                    scripts
                    much easier to read when using very specific semantic markup elements rather than making everything
                    divs
                    and giving them classes or IDs to define what they're meant to be instead of using semantic markup
                    to
                    define it for you. Which in essence actually makes my life easier and the person reading the
                    script's
                    life easier.
