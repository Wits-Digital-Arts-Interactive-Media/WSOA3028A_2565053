    <H2>My experience with github.</H2>

    <P>
      Setting up github and my page was fairly straightforward. I had previously used github for a few of my projects hence the reason for it being straightforward.I am also comfortable with using branches, so if I ever need to do <br>
      something very specific so if I ever need to do something very specific for my site I can certainly break down my work, and push to the necessary branches if need be.<br>

    <H2>Reading reflection - as we may think by S.Hrarer</H2>   

    <p>
      For this week, I have decided to choose the reading "As we may think" by Simon Harper. I found this to be quite an interesting read. As I began reading I came across something which I previously did not know about, and that is   <br>
      Differential analyser. Which I did some research on and the main thing that stood out to me was the way that the analyser worked and how well all the inter connected parts worked in sync. More than that, I found that Bush's      <br>
      inability to conform to the current digital technologies at the time was more interesting to me. As his position posed many questions. What is that he see's in his system, so much so that he has closed the book on current digital<br>
      technologies at the time ? Well, to my understanding I see the light in his position with regards to the idea of association. When I think about the nature of this course, I realise that it's largely encompassed beyond mere      <br>
      search engines. It certainly filled with information, and looking back on Bush's idea of assocation we to need ways of understanding this information in by the World Wide Web. Which goes far different ways. I will attempt to     <br>
      lean into something I believe that could certainly tie into this idea of assocation. My understanding goes back to something I learnt in my first year of study. Which was the semiotic approach by Ferdinand de Saussure, where     <br>
      the approach saw languages as systems of signs. From what I understand this information presented to us on the Web, a large part of this is due to way the semiotics work. In essence, Information is being presented to us, we <br>
      have our own way of understanding that information. Through the conventions and the perceptions we have formed and have come to experience.<br>
