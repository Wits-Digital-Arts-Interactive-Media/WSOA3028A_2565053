    <P class="Paragraph-Style">
      Setting up github and my page was fairly straightforward. I had previously used github for a few of my projects hence the reason 
      for it being straightforward.I am also comfortable with using branches, so if I ever need to do something very specific so if I 
      ever need to do something very specific for my site I can certainly break down my work, and push to the necessary branches if need be.

    <H2 id="Week1-Header">Reading reflection - as we may think by S.Hrarer</H2>   
  
    <p>
      For this week, I have decided to choose the reading "As we may think" by Simon Harper. I found this to be quite an interesting read. As 
      I began reading I came across something which I previously did not know about, and that is Differential analyser. Which I did some research
      on and the main thing that stood out to me was the way that the analyser worked and how well all the inter connected parts worked in sync.
      More than that, I found that Bush's inability to conform to the current digital technologies at the time was more interesting to me. As his 
      position posed many questions. What is that he see's in his system, so much so that he has closed the book on current digital technologies
      at the time ? Well, to my understanding I see the light in his position with regards to the idea of association. When I think about the 
      nature of this course, I realise that it's largely encompassed beyond mere search engines. It certainly filled with information, and looking 
      back on Bush's idea of assocation we to need ways of understanding this information in by the World Wide Web. Which goes far different ways. 
      I will attempt to lean into something I believe that could certainly tie into this idea of assocation. My understanding goes back to something 
      I learnt in my first year of study. Which was the semiotic approach by Ferdinand de Saussure, where the approach saw languages as systems of signs.
      From what I understand this information presented to us on the Web, a large part of this is due to way the semiotics work. In essence, Information
      is being presented to us, we have our own way of understanding that information. Through the conventions and the perceptions we have formed and have come to experience.<br

    <h2 id="Week 2 Header">Folder Structure and URL Scheme</h2>

    <p id="Paragraph-Style2">
      With some of my previous knowledge on building games I am fully aware that organizing my project is like laying the groundwork 
      for a building; it needs to be robust and well-planned. I've opted for a clear and intuitive folder structure that ensures easy 
      navigation for both development and future updates. Each section of my website has its dedicated folder, and I've incorporated a 
      logical URL scheme that reflects the content hierarchy. My overall folder structure not only facilitates easy navigation during 
      development but also sets a solid foundation for future scalability and makes the processing of updating my website much easier. 
      This will not only streamline the development process for me but also enhances user experience.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Week 2 Header">Decision-Making Process</h2>
    <p id="Paragraph-Style2">
      I based my decisions on the simplicity and scalability of the structure. A well-organized folder system not only aids in development but 
      also facilitates content updates without causing chaos. The URL scheme, being an extension of this, contributes to creating user-friendly 
      and easily shareable links.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="Week 2 Header">Thoughts Behind Wireframes</h2>
    <p id="Paragraph-Style2">
      In these early stages, I'm focusing on the fundamental elements â€“ navigation, content placement, and user interaction. The wireframes serve 
      as a blueprint, helping me conceptualize the user journey and fine-tune the design before delving into the intricacies of coding with HTML.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="Week 2 Header">UI Wire frames</h2>

    <p id="Paragraph-Style2">Before I began designing my UI wireframes, I thought about how I would like my website to look. I then researched 
      further and found out that each section of a web page is defined by specific sections, which have specific names. E.G The hero section - A
      prominent and visually striking section at the top of a webpage. It is one of the first elements that users see when they land on a website,
      typically occupying a large portion of the screen. The hero section serves as a crucial introduction, capturing the attention of visitors 
      and conveying key messages about the website or brand.<br>
      <br>
      With the image I had in mind combined with my new found knowledge of the specific sections of a webpage. I decided to map out the image in
      my mind, with a better way of defining the specific sections and with that I came up with the first wireframe for my Home Page below.

    <h2 id="Week 2 Header">Reflecting on Moulthrop, S. (2003)</h2>
    <p id="Paragraph-Style2">
      Moulthrop's 'You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)' is a thought-provoking piece that resonates even in today's
      internet landscape. Drawing parallels between hypertext and the internet, Moulthrop challenges us to rethink our approach to information 
      dissemination. How do the evolving laws of media shape our digital experiences? It's a question worth pondering as we navigate the dynamic online world.<br>
      <br>
      Delving into this inquiry, let's explore how hypertext, a revolutionary concept in information organization, profoundly influences our online encounters. 
      The internet's structural foundation, heavily shaped by hypertext principles, initiates a paradigm shift in the way information is not only presented but, 
      more crucially, how users access and navigate this vast digital landscape.<br>
      <br>
      Consider hyperlinks as dynamic connectors, acting as pathways within this expansive information network. These virtual bridges empower users, allowing them 
      to effortlessly traverse the digital realm, hopping between diverse topics and ideas with unprecedented ease. Unlike the traditional linear pathways, hypertext 
      introduces a non-linear structure, providing users with the freedom to craft their own unique journeys through the vast sea of interconnected content.<br>
      <br>
      This interconnected web of information fundamentally shapes our online experiences. It transforms the act of exploration from a rigid, linear process into a 
      fluid and intuitive one. Users are no longer confined to a predetermined route; instead, they navigate a web of possibilities, following their curiosity and 
      seamlessly jumping between different information nodes. This dynamic, interconnected approach not only enhances user engagement but also encourages a more
      participatory and personalized digital experience.<br>
      <br>
      In essence, by understanding the impact of hypertext, we gain insight into the intricate architecture of the internet, where the way information is structured
      mirrors the flexibility and interconnectedness of human thought. The virtual pathways created by hyperlinks contribute to a digital landscape where exploration 
      feels natural, intuitive, and uniquely tailored to each user's preferences and curiosities. This transformative influence underscores the enduring relevance of 
      Moulthrop's insights as we navigate the complexities of the ever-evolving online world.

    <h2 id="Week 3 Header">Interaction and the WWW</h2>
    <p id="Paragraph-Style2">
      Interaction, to me, is the heartbeat of the World Wide Web. It's the bridge between users and content, making the online experience dynamic 
      and engaging. As I craft my project, I'm keeping user interaction at the forefront. How can I make the user experience seamless and enjoyable? 
      What interactive elements will enhance engagement? These are the questions guiding my design choices.

    <p id="Paragraph-Style3"> 
      My goal for this website is to create a website that displays my work, my ability or any previous projects I had made solely for employers 
      in the programming and/or people in the gaming industry, as this is my target audience regarding this website. I want this to be a token of 
      my ability that shows I am able to get the job done and get it done well, with maximum efficency. <br>
      <br>
      Overall, I will make this website easy to read and easy for the employers to navigate, with all my work and ability being displayed through 
      this website. I want the user to understand my intentions right from the jump, the user needs to know exactly what my website is(Portfolio).
    </p>

    <h1 id="Week 3 Header">Site content</h1>
    
    <h3 id="Paragraph-Style3">Below is an illustration of my site's content:</h2>
    <img src="../../Images/WebsiteContent.jpg">

    <P id="Paragraph-Style3-Site content">
      <b>Homepage</b> - The heart of my website is the homepage. As this will be the central point that links the 4 other pages that I am looking to have.<br>
      <b>Blog posts</b> - The page for all my courses blogposts for each week.<br>
      <b>Web design</b> - I am planning to have the outline for my process of how I went about designing my website.<br>
      <b>Portfolio</b> - My goal with this page is to be able to display any projects that I had previously did before, the aim is to showcase my abilty in 
      programming and game design. I will try to include some downloadabe files, for users to be able to interact with my projects. I am not quite sure how the whole process of using files.
    </P>

    <h2 id="Week 3 Header">Reflect on how the exercise above relates to what you know about your structure and URL scheme, 
    and how it relates to semantic markup </h2>
    
    <p id="Paragraph-Style3">The exercise above relates to this idea of structure. A structure that is very carefully designed, for the sole purpose
      that your users lives are made easy. Through careful design, and mapping out the way a user navigates your site is imperative 
      for the user overall experience. As having a user navigate a unstructured site aimlessly will not only have a negative effect 
      on their experience, but it will clearly indicate the ineffectiveness of a websites design.<br>
      <br>
      As for how it relates to semantic markup. From what I've looked at, semantic markup makes your code easier to understand for 
      other developers or people who may view this project, or for myself as well. Just as a well-organized folder structure helps 
      locate files more easily, semantic markup assists in the understanding of the content structure more intuitively.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="Week 3 Header">Reflect on your development progress for the week</h2>

    <p id="Paragraph-Style3">This week I have not done much coding. I decided to take some more time  to delve into HTML, during this time I learnt
      a lot about HTML. I am certain that upon the next coding session I would be able to implement a lot of the ideas I have using HTML. During
      this time, I did a lot of research and watched multiple tutorials on HTML. I learnt about the importance of semantic markup language and I
      am excited to put my new found knowledge to the test.
