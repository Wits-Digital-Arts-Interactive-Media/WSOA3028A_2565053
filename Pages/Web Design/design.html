                Below is the first iteration of my website's design process:
            </p>

            <h3 id="Design-header-Conent">Alignment</h3>
            <p id="Design-Paragraph Style1">
                My goal for this website is to create a website that displays my work, my ability or any previous projects I had made solely for employers 
                in the programming and/or people in the gaming industry, as this is my target audience regarding this website. I want this to be a token of 
                my ability that shows I am able to get the job done and get it done well, with maximum efficency. <br>
                <br>
                Overall, I will make this website easy to read and easy for the employers to navigate, with all my work and ability being displayed through 
                this website. I want the user to understand my intentions right from the jump, the user needs to know exactly what my website is(Portfolio).
            </p>
    
            <h3 id="Design-header-Conent">Site Content</h3>
            <img src="../../Images//Web design/WebsiteContent.jpg">
            <P id="Design-Paragraph Style1">
              <b>Homepage</b> - The heart of my website is the homepage. As this will be the central point that links the 4 other pages that I am looking to have.<br>
              <b>Blog posts</b> - The page for all my courses blogposts for each week.<br>
              <b>Web design</b> - I am planning to have the outline for my process of how I went about designing my website.<br>
              <b>Portfolio</b> - My goal with this page is to be able to display any projects that I had previously did before, the aim is to showcase my abilty in 
              programming and game design. I will try to include some downloadabe files, for users to be able to interact with my projects. I am not quite sure how the whole process of using files.
            </P>
    
            <h3 id ="Design-InfoStructure-Content"></p>Information Structure</h3>
            <p id ="Design-Paragraph-Style1">Below you can see the information structure that I am trying to implement. The cycling between pages smoothly is 
            represented by the green arrows. The user is able to cycle between rach web page back and forth. But the structure cleaely shows that it will
            require the user to go back to the home page at all times.

            <h3 id ="Design-UserFlow-Content"></p>User Flow</h3>
            <p id ="Design-Paragraph-Style1"> Below you can see a diagram of the user flow for my website:</p>
            <img id= "UserFlow-Photo" src="../../Images/Web design/UserFlow.jpg">
        
            <h3 id ="Design-InterfaceElement-Content"></p>Interface Elements</h3>
            <p id ="Design-Paragraph-Style1">In designing my website's interface elements, simplicity and functionality will be paramount. Each element, from
              buttons to navigation bars, I will meticulously craft to prioritize ease of use and clarity. Embracing minimalist aesthetics, I will ensure 
              that every interface element served a clear purpose without unnecessary distractions.By prioritizing simplicity and functionality in 
              interface design, I aimed to enhance the overall user experience and facilitate effortless interaction with the content.
            </p>
        
            <h3 id ="Design-StyleProcess-Content"></p>Style Process</h3>
            <p id ="Design-Paragraph-Style1">In crafting my website's design, I prioritized minimalism and clarity. The color palette, featuring muted tones and
              subtle contrasts, aims to create a tranquil backdrop that directs focus to the content. Clean lines and sufficent whitespace in the layout 
              enhance readability and navigation, fostering a sense of sophistication. Sans-serif fonts is what I will be looking at for their simplicity
              and legibility, ensuring seamless readability across screens. Every design decision was made with a commitment to simplicity, functionality,
              and user experience at its core.
