                Below is the first iteration of my website's design process and the UI wireframes:
            </p>

            <h3 id="Design-header-Conent">Alignment</h3>
            <p id="Design-Paragraph-Style1">
                My goal for this website is to create a website that displays my work, my ability or any previous
                projects I had made solely for employers
                in the programming and/or people in the gaming industry, as this is my target audience regarding
                this website. I want this to be a token of
                my ability that shows I am able to get the job done and get it done well, with maximum efficency.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall, I will make this website easy to read and easy for the employers to navigate, with all my
                work and ability being displayed through
                this website. I want the user to understand my intentions right from the jump, the user needs to
                know exactly what my website is(Portfolio).
            </p>

            
            <h3 id="Design-header-Conent">Site Content</h3>
            <img src="../../Images//Web design/WebsiteContent.jpg" alt="Website Content">
            <p id="Design-Paragraph-Style1">
                <b>Homepage</b> - The heart of my website is the homepage. As this will be the central point that
                links the 4 other pages that I am looking to have.<br>
                <b>Blog posts</b> - The page for all my courses blogposts for each week.<br>
                <b>Web design</b> - I am planning to have the outline for my process of how I went about designing
                my website.<br>
                <b>Portfolio</b> - My goal with this page is to be able to display any projects that I had
                previously did before, the aim is to showcase my abilty in
                programming and game design. I will try to include some downloadabe files, for users to be able to
                interact with my projects. I am not quite sure how the whole process of using files.

            <h3 id="Design-InfoStructure-Content">Information Structure</h3>
            <p id="Design-Paragraph-Style1">Below you can see the information structure that I am trying to
                implement. The cycling between pages smoothly is
                represented by the green arrows. The user is able to cycle between rach web page back and forth. But
                the structure cleaelyshows that it will
                require the user to go back to the home page at all times.

            <h3 id="Design-UserFlow-Content">User Flow</h3>
            <p id="Design-Paragraph-Style1"> Below you can see a diagram of the user flow for my website:</p>
            <img id="UserFlow-Photo" src="../../Images/Web design/UserFlow.jpg" alt="User Flow">

            <h3 id="Design-InterfaceElement-Content">Interface Elements</h3>
            <p id="Design-Paragraph-Style1">In designing my website's interface elements, simplicity and
                functionality will be paramount. Each element, from
                buttons to navigation bars, I will meticulously craft to prioritize ease of use and clarity.
                Embracing minimalist aesthetics, I will ensure
                that every interface element served a clear purpose without unnecessary distractions.By prioritizing
                simplicity and functionality in
                interface design, I aimed to enhance the overall user experience and facilitate effortless
                interaction with the content.
            </p>

            <h3 id="Design-StyleProcess-Content">Style Process</h3>
            <p id="Design-Paragraph-Style1">In crafting my website's design, I prioritized minimalism and clarity.
                The color palette, featuring muted tones and
                subtle contrasts, aims to create a tranquil backdrop that directs focus to the content. Clean lines
                and sufficent whitespace in the layout
                enhance readability and navigation, fostering a sense of sophistication. Sans-serif fonts is what I
                will be looking at for their simplicity
                and legibility, ensuring seamless readability across screens. Every design decision was made with a
                commitment to simplicity, functionality,
                and user experience at its core.
