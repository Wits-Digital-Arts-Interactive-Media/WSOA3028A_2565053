                    Below is the first iteration of my website's design process and the UI wieframes:

                <p id="Design-Paragraph Style1">
                    My goal for this website is to create a website that displays my work, my ability or any previous
                    projects I had made solely for employers
                    in the programming and/or people in the gaming industry, as this is my target audience regarding
                    this website. I want this to be a token of
                    my ability that shows I am able to get the job done and get it done well, with maximum efficency.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, I will make this website easy to read and easy for the employers to navigate, with all my
                    work and ability being displayed through
                    this website. I want the user to understand my intentions right from the jump, the user needs to
                    know exactly what my website is(Portfolio).
                </p>

                <h3 id="Design-header-Conent">Site Content</h3>

                <P id="Design-Paragraph Style1">
                    <b>Homepage</b> - The heart of my website is the homepage. As this will be the central point that
                    links the 4 other pages that I am looking to have.<br>
                    <b>Blog posts</b> - The page for all my courses blogposts for each week.<br>
                    <b>Web design</b> - I am planning to have the outline for my process of how I went about designing
                    my website.<br>
                    <b>Portfolio</b> - My goal with this page is to be able to display any projects that I had
                    previously did before, the aim is to showcase my abilty in
                    programming and game design. I will try to include some downloadabe files, for users to be able to
                    interact with my projects. I am not quite sure how the whole process of using files.
                </P>

                <h3 id="Design-InfoStructure-Content">
                    </p>Information Structure</h3>
                <p id="Design-Paragraph-Style1">Below you can see the information structure that I am trying to
                    implement. The cycling between pages smoothly is
                    represented by the green arrows. The user is able to cycle between rach web page back and forth. But
                    the structure cleaely shows that it will
                    require the user to go back to the home page at all times.

                <h3 id="Design-InterfaceElement-Content">
                    </p>Interface Elements</h3>
                <p id="Design-Paragraph-Style1">In designing my website's interface elements, simplicity and
                    functionality will be paramount. Each element, from
                    buttons to navigation bars, I will meticulously craft to prioritize ease of use and clarity.
                    Embracing minimalist aesthetics, I will ensure
                    that every interface element served a clear purpose without unnecessary distractions.By prioritizing
                    simplicity and functionality in
                    interface design, I aimed to enhance the overall user experience and facilitate effortless
                    interaction with the content.
                </p>

                <h3 id="Design-StyleProcess-Content">
                    </p>Style Process</h3>
                <p id="Design-Paragraph-Style1">In crafting my website's design, I prioritized minimalism and clarity.
                    The color palette, featuring muted tones and
                    subtle contrasts, aims to create a tranquil backdrop that directs focus to the content. Clean lines
                    and sufficent whitespace in the layout
                    enhance readability and navigation, fostering a sense of sophistication. Sans-serif fonts is what I
                    will be looking at for their simplicity
                    and legibility, ensuring seamless readability across screens. Every design decision was made with a
                    commitment to simplicity, functionality,
                    and user experience at its core.
