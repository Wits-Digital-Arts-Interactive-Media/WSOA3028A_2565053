                        with iteration 2, I am aiming to improve the idea of making certain aspects of
                        my
                        website more scalable,<br>

                        it's
                        most organized state. Hence,<br>
                        the main changes I will make is regarding the additional folders I
                        have
                        opted to include. For each of the<br>
                        main 6 web pages. They will all have their own folder,
                        relating to
                        the individual aspects of the website<br> which I have broken up into 4 main sections. The HTML
                        part,
                        the CSS part, the Java and lastly the<br>
                        images I am planning to include. These changes are purely
                        for

                        my current structure for my blogposts not being<br>
                        scalable. I then decided to look further into
                        all of
                        my folders and the solution above is what I derived at.

            <h4>Colour Palette:</h4>
            <p>
                In the process of designing our website, I meticulously curated a color palette that embodies our my
                websites ethos and enhances user experience. I have 2 colour palettes I am closely considering,
                consisting of muted tones such as soft blues and earthy neutrals, was carefully selected to evoke a
                sense of calmness and professionalism. By incorporating subtle contrasts, I aimed to create visual
                interest without overwhelming the user. For instance, the use of a complementary accent color for
                interactive elements adds vibrancy and draws attention to key actions. This thoughtful application of
                color not only establishes visual coherence but also contributes to a harmonious and inviting
                atmosphere.
                The chosen colour pallettes can be seen below:

            </figure>



            <h4>Layout and Whitespace:</h4>
            <p>My website's layout is characterized by clean lines, balanced proportions, and ample whitespace. I will
                ensure each element is thoughtfully positioned to optimize visual hierarchy and streamline navigation.
                The strategic use of whitespace not only enhances readability but also creates a sense of spaciousness
                and sophistication. For example, generous margins around text blocks and images provide breathing room,
                allowing content to stand out and engage the user effectively. Furthermore, the grid-based layout
                ensures consistency and structure, facilitating a seamless browsing experience across devices.
            </p>

            <h4>Typography:</h4>
            <p>The choice of typography plays a pivotal role in shaping my website's personality and readability. I
                opted for sans-serif fonts for their modernity, versatility, and legibility, aligning with my minimalist
                design aesthetic. Specifically, I selected fonts with clean lines and open letterforms to ensure optimal
                readability across different screen sizes and resolutions. By maintaining a cohesive typographic
                hierarchy, I will guide the user's attention and convey information with clarity and elegance. Moreover,
                the use of font weights and styles, such as bold headings and italicized accents, adds visual interest
                and reinforces content hierarchy.
                
                The fount I will use can be seen down below:

            </figure>

            <h4>Interactive Elements:</h4>
            <p>Incorporating interactive elements into my design will be a deliberate decision aimed at enhancing user
                engagement and interactivity. For instance, subtle animations and transitions add dynamism and depth to
                the user experience, creating a sense of fluidity and responsiveness. Additionally, intuitive navigation
                menus and prominent call-to-action buttons facilitate seamless navigation and encourage user
                interaction. By striking a balance between functionality and aesthetics, I ensure that interactive
                elements complement the overall design narrative while providing meaningful utility to the user.
