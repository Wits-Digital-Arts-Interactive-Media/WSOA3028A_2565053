            <p id="Ancient-Egypt-Info" style="text-align: left;">This prototype was developed for a final examination by 3 group members and myself. 
            I was in charge of a large part of the development of the game, from the programming side. The game was complex in the context of the 
            systems we were trying to implement, coupled with numerous narrative elements.<br>
